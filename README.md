# RSS Virtual Keyboard
This task is to create a virtual keyboard.
### Functional requirements:
- design is at your discretion
- index.html file should be empty (all the necessary elements are generated with the usage of JS)
- pressing a key on a physical keyboard highlights the key on the virtual keyboard
- if several buttons are pressed, all the pressed buttons are highlighted on the virtual keyboard (there're no exceptions for `Ctrl`, `Alt`, and `Shift` as well)
